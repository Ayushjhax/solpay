Users can generate QR codes representing payment requests, which can be scanned by others to initiate transactions seamlessly.

## Project Overview

The Solana Pay DApp aims to simplify digital payments within the ONDC ecosystem by leveraging the efficiency and security of blockchain technology. By integrating with UPI, the DApp enables users to make and receive payments swiftly and securely, addressing the needs of the rapidly growing digital economy in India.

Key features of the Solana Pay DApp include:

- Generation of QR codes representing payment requests.
- Seamless integration with the UPI payment system in India.

- Scalable infrastructure capable of handling increasing transaction volumes.

By providing a user-friendly interface for UPI payments on the Solana blockchain, this DApp contributes to financial inclusion and economic growth in India. It empowers individuals and businesses to transact digitally with ease, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the country.

## UPI in India

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It allows users to link multiple bank accounts in a single mobile application and enables seamless fund transfers between different banks instantly.
